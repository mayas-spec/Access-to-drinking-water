# Access to Drinking Water: A Data-Driven Exploration  
This project delves into the global challenge of providing **safe and affordable drinking water**, focusing on disparities, trends, and progress toward achieving **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)**.  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

## 🌍 Key Insights  

### 1. **Data Gaps in Reporting**  
- **Yearly Representation**: Data collection was inconsistent for some countries, with gaps of several years between reports.  
- **Analysis Approach**: Average intervals between data points were calculated to better understand the trends.  

### 2. **Annual Rate of Change (ARC)**  
- Trends showed **varied progress** across national, rural, and urban populations.  
- Rural areas frequently lagged behind, highlighting a persistent urban-rural divide in water access.  

### 3. **Regional Disparities**  
- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Progress remains slow, with projections estimating full access only by **2080** at the current rate of improvement.  
- Other regions displayed faster progress, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in underperforming areas.  

### 4. **Full Access Analysis**  
- **100% Access Reporting**: Some countries reported universal access, yet significant disparities exist when examining rural versus urban populations.  

## 📌 Why This Matters  
Access to clean water is a **fundamental human right**, yet millions globally still lack this basic necessity. Understanding the data behind these challenges provides insights for crafting effective policies and interventions to close the gaps and accelerate progress toward universal access.  

## 💡 Next Steps  
This analysis sets the foundation for further exploration, including:  
- Examining the **drivers behind regional disparities**.  
- Identifying successful strategies in countries with rapid progress.  
- Proposing **actionable recommendations** for improving access in lagging regions.
